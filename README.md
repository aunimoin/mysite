# Portfolio Expectations

*   You must have a professional domain name where your portfolio site lives. So for example **ericandrewlewis.com** is great but **detective-distortion-5782.bitballoon.com** is not okay.

*   Your site should contain links to as many projects and assignments that will help convey the skills you want to highlight to potential employers.

*   You must have an about me section that contains an "about me" paragraph. This will be your brand statement and something outcomes will help you develop.

*   Your site should be written with the **mobile first** mindset and must be responsive so first start with wireframing it out so you know what the two versions will look like. Once your site is deployed you can test it's responsive desing using [http://ami.responsivedesign.is/](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/)
